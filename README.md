        Description
        The TStretchHandle component for Delphi has been significantly improved over its early incarnation as an experimental first component. Version 2.0 has better support for manipulating multiple child components, features more consistent visual behaviour, and has been tested with both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.

This Release was for Delphi 1 as a component
I modify it in two modification
- Remove the "component" behaviour
    Now it's a unit that you call and create manually
- Make it support Delphi 11
    Even if the program is from 1996 it's working good on Windows 11 with the latest version of Delphi (11.3 as my last test)
    
I've commit the original file as a first commit so you can compare my modification for the Delphi 11 version (wich is more debug than adaptation)
You will see that a 1996 Delphi file is still simple and relevant in 2023

Thanks to Anthony Scott for the original part
